Instead of pointing to //third_party/freetype public_deps for the else case should point to something like //build/freetype on the Chrome side in which we have a group() GN statement which either uses system FreeType (on Linux, for now) or redirects to //third_party/freetype to build our own in Chrome on Windows.\n\nI\u0027ll prepare the Chrome side for a target that we can use here.\n\nOr do we need a third case here for building pdfium standalone, not as part of the Chrome build, with system FreeType? In that case we would need a variable to detect whether we\u0027re inside the Chrome build.",
