      "message": "So here, //third_party/ would point to a) in PDFiums standalone case to PDFiums //third_party/freetype DEPS checkout, and b) in Chromium\u0027s embedded case, to Chromium\u0027s //third-party/freetype? \n\nThis happens to work now but it\u0027s a bit brittle if Chromium or PDFium decides to rename or move their freetype directories and do that not in sync. Do we still need the bundled configuration inside Chromium?",

      "message": "Yes, this is brittle in the sense that the two projects have to be aligned. I imagine we are not going to be moving FreeType code around too often, but if we do, we\u0027ll do the two in a synchronized manner.\n\nWe still need the bundled configuration on Chromium Mac. Since Chromium\u0027s build_overrides/pdfium.gni has pdf_bundle_freetype_override set that way. If we set pdf_bundle_freetype_override \u003d false in Chromium, then in principle that means something else, though in practice not much changes.",
