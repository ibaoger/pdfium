      "message": "Today, skiapaths maintains two separate clipstacks; one for skia and one pdfium\u0027s implementation. I\u0027d like for the !skipapaths implementation to only require a single clipstack, and be able to return the current clip bounds from that.\n\nAlso, the pdfium implementation returns a way oversized box, since it only supports clipping through bitmap masks. Since Skia clips geometrically, it can get away with a tight clip bounds. The current callers of GetClipBox erroneously depend on the oversized box, so fixing this requires upstream work as well.",
