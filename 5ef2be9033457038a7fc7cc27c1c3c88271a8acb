      "message": "I think this API needs to be extended a bit. Just knowing the points in the path doesn\u0027t necessarily help you as you need to know what type of point it is. Is it a LINE_TO, MOVE_TO, BEZIER_TO. Just having the points doesn\u0027t tell you what to do with them.\n\nWe probably want this to return a FPDF_PathNode object which is a void* and here we just return the FX_PATHPOINT static cast to the FPDF_PathNode.\n\nThen we add methods to get the FPDF_PathNodeType, FPDF_PathNodePoint, FPDF_PathNodeIsClose which correspond to the params in FX_PATHPOINT.\n\n(Note, FPDF_PathNode is a terrible name and I can\u0027t think of a better one off the top of my head)\n\nLet me know if you don\u0027t have time to make these changes and I\u0027ll see what we can do.",
