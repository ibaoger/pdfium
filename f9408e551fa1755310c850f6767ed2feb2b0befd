      "message": "I agree with the virtual methods gone, we should simplify. But shouldn\u0027t we preserve checks like this?\n\nUsing the first page number as an example, in the document, it\u0027s stored in a dictionary as an integer. With the existing code, we store the int into CPDF_LinearizedHeader::m_dwFirstPageNo which is uint32_t, then we cast it back to int in CPDF_HintTables::GetFirstPageObjectNumber().\n\nWith this CL, isn\u0027t it just going to reinterpret a negative first page number as a very large positive value instead? Can CPDF_LinearizedHeader just return the raw value, and let the caller decide what to do with it?",
