I\u0027m thinking of moving CPWL_Color to core/fxge/cfx_color (and remaning the CFX_Color in XFA to CXFA_Color as it\u0027s more then just colour).\n\nThat would fix the layering issue here. I\u0027m also interested in trying to remove a bunch of FX_ARGB, FX_COLORREF and FX_CMYK things and converting them to CFX_Color, although I\u0027m not sure if that would cause performance issues or not.",
