      "message": "This code is confusing and, I think, I simplifed it.\n\nIt was looking for FontSize properties first and setting those into pImportant or pLatest and then apply the font size if bPriority was set.\n\nIf !bPriority we would find the other styles and apply them. We\u0027d apply non-important styles immediately and then loop over the important styles and apply those. We\u0027d then grab (a random) custom properties and apply those (this part seems like a bug).",

After font size is set properly, nonimportant properties are set. Important non-font-size properties are also set, but making sure that there\u0027s no consecutive in a row (no idea why they would need this). Finally, custom styles from the last important non-font-size are applied.",
